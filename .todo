# uFSM todolist

cleanup:
    [ ]     We do not want to decay the types passed to entry/exit - the decision if the member
            function can be called (has_entry, has_exit) needs to be taken while taking qualifiers
            into consideration. We should also consider if that's not the case for other
            actions - guard, action, handle_event, etc.
    [ ]     Fix naming for consistency

features:
    [ ]     We could support different signatures for various actions - e.g. we may want to support
            both `void entry(SM&)` and `void entry(SM&, Event)` - same for all other actions.
            Is this a good idea?
    [ ]     Support eventless transitions? This would allow for intermediate states - states that
            the control is just passing through while transitioning from one state to another.
    [ ]     Propagate events down to nested state machines after an entry is triggered?
            This would potentially allow for elimination of explicit `substate<S>` on transitions?
            An alternative wold be to pass events to guards and actions. Coupling eventle
    [ ]     Implement orthogonal regions
