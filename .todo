# uFSM todolist

cleanup:
    [x]     Implement separate wrappers for state, event and next-state for the front end
    [ ]     Fix naming for consistency
    [x]     Potential refactoring - see if it's possible to get rid of CRTP
                * Type of the transition_table() should be inferable. A typelist could be
                constructed based on the `State` of each transition_table entry - it would need to
                be filtered on construction to ensure that each `State` type is inserted exactly
                once in the typelist. Given the `State` typelist it would no longer be necessaary
                to have client code inherit from uFSM.
